<center><p>My parents tell the story of when I was less than a year old, and my father and sister were playing in the deep end of the pool. 
	I was sitting on the steps, but I wanted to be with them, so I put my head down and paddled over. No one had taught me, I just did it. 
	That has been my modus operandi ever since.</p>
<p>Being mildly autistic, I was slow to develop speech, so to communicate I would draw. I spent hours standing at the chalkboard, drawing, erasing, then drawing again.
	Later, using markers on paper, I would finish one drawing straight after another. It should come as no surprise that when I learned to create digital art, 
	I would pursue it with the same dogged dedication and confidence – learning by doing.</p>
<p>In grade school, I would create crude video animatics. Years later, having discovered digital art speedpaint videos, I learned to reproduce anything that caught my eye.
	That then led me to pursue a degree in Graphic Design at Seminole State College, and now Game Design at University of Central Florida.</p> 
<p>I have spent thousands of hours creating digital art and building my portfolio. I have learned how to compose an illustration utilizing perspective, color theory, 
	conveying emotion in each character’s face, eyes, and body, thus telling their stories.</p>
<p>My skills include every app in Adobe Suite as well as Maya and ZBrush. I excel in vectorized art, raster illustration, photomanipulation, compositing, 
	formatting and animation, as well as video creation and editing. I’ve even published a book of short stories with my own illustrated cover art!
