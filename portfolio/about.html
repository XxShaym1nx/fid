<center><p>According to her parents, when she was less than a year old, and her father and sister were playing in the deep end of the pool. 
	She was sitting on the steps, but wanted to be with them, so she put my head down and paddled over. No one had taught her, she just did it. 
	That has been her modus operandi ever since.</p>
<p>Being mildly autistic, she was slow to develop speech, so to communicate she would draw. She spent hours standing at the chalkboard, drawing, erasing, then drawing again.
	Later, using markers on paper, she would finish one drawing straight after another. It should come as no surprise that when she learned to create digital art, 
	she would pursue it with the same dogged dedication and confidence – learning by doing.</p>
<p>In grade school, she would create crude video animatics. Years later, having discovered digital art speedpaint videos, she learned to reproduce anything that caught her eye.
	That led her to pursue a degree in Graphic Design at Seminole State College, and now Game Design at University of Central Florida.</p> 
<p>She has spent thousands of hours creating digital art and building my portfolio. She has learned how to compose an illustration utilizing perspective, color theory, 
	conveying emotion in each character’s face, eyes, and body, thus telling their stories.</p>
<p>Her skills include every app in Adobe Suite as well as Maya and ZBrush. She excels in vectorized art, raster illustration, photomanipulation, compositing, 
	formatting and animation, as well as video creation and editing. She has published a book of short stories with my own illustrated cover art.
