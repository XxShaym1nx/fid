<h2>Scottish Fold Cats</h2>

<p>Cute cat species, right? Well, it's not so cute when you learn the truth- much like Manx cats, scottish folds get their ears from <b>deliberate inbreeding and genetic mutations. DO NOT ADOPT A SCOTTISH FOLD, YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING THE INBREEDING INDUSTRY!</b></p>
<h2>Sphynx Cats</h2>

<p>Be warned- sphynx cats can cost upwards of <b>thousands</b> of dollars to adopt! Though, they are fit to adopt if you are allergic to cat fur- <b>of which the sphynx has none.</b></p>
<h2>Siamese Cats</h2>

<p>Siamese cats are quiet, peaceful, and very friendly with people. The ultimate <b>go-to</b> choice for adopting a cat. If you can, take one immediately.</p>
<h2>Tigers</h2>

<p>Full stop. Don't even bother with these.</p>
