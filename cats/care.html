<center><p>Everyone loves cats! But does that necessarily mean they know how to take care of cats?<br></center>
<h2>Feeding Your Cats</h2>

<p>Feeding your cats is the next most important thing of all to do, second to giving them water. Set a specific time 3 times a day for your cat to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner so they can live comfortably and predictably.</p>
<p>Any generic brand name pet food will work for most cats, but in case of old cats, it is recommended you give them softer food so they can chew better.</p>
<p>Also I can't stress this enough: <b>DO NOT FEED CATS MILK!</b> ALL CATS ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, IT WILL <b>KILL THEM!</b></p>

<h2>Interacting With Your Cats</h2>
<img src="play.jpg" alt="playing with cat"width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Cats love to play! Make sure to buy lots of toys so the two of you can play together. But don't buy catnip, or they'll get <b>addicted!</b></p>
<h2>Bathroom Time With Your Cats</h2>
<img src="litter.jpg" alt="cat litter box"width="20%" height="20%">
<p>Do not bother to bathe your cats. Cats hate water, and they bathe themselves with their own tongue! But do remember to clean their litter box at least once a day.</p>
